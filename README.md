Refined Echo JS
===============

> Chrome extension that beautifies [Echo JS](http://www.echojs.com) and adds useful features

<h6 align="center">
This extension is <del>blatantly copied</del> highly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github">Refined GitHub</a>.

I visit Echo JS regularly and want to _modernize_ its design and functionalities.

My hope is that Echo JS will notice and implement some of these improvements.

Status

This is extension is currently work in progress. Feature and pull requests are
appreciated.
