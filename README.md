Refined Echo JS

> Chrome extension that beautifies [Echo JS](http://www.echojs.com) and adds useful features

<h6 align="center">
This extension is <del>blatantly copied</del> highly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github">Refined GitHub</a>.

I visit Echo JS regularly and want to _modernize_ its design and functionalities.

My hope is that Echo JS will notice and implement some of these improvements.

Status
